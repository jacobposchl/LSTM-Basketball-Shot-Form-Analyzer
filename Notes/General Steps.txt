Right Now:

	Fixes:

		ENHANCE COMPUTATION:
			-Test out new best.pt file -> is significant increase in accuracy?
			-Implement DeepSORT to enhance tracking algorithm of ball
			-Parallel computing? Can be used with DeepSORT?
				-maybe object detection on different process that rendering skeleton?
		
		DATA ENGINEERING:		
			-Determine how to use SHAP to classify what columns influence good v bad shots
			
		GCP COMPUTING:
			-create VM instance for replacing local machine:
				-has same project dependencies


TO - DO:

-Data Engineering:

-Setup the model (LSTM architecture)
	-Start with basic, see how accuracy performs with amount of data used ****BIG STEP
		-(make sure model.add(Masking() is added before model.add(LSTM())))
	-Do more research on LSTM models and tensorflow
	-Upgrade model, see how it performs compared to previous, basic model

-Convert outputs of model to useful insights for users
	-Converting model output to text user can understand
	-Visualization of differences in your form vs your "good form"

EXTRAS:
-3d angles?? allow use of different angled vidoes
	-redo all frame calls in code make sure accurate in dataset
-Add important features to outputted dataset
	-Wrist/Hand/Finger Position/Vel
	-Distance between all joints (instead of polynomial feature extraction)
