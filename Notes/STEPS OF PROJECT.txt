STEPS OF PROJECT:

tracking the form of a basketball jumpshot
mediapipe -> skeleton of the player's jumpshot
implement into a dataframe
columns:
-joint position
-joint angle
-joint velocity
-joint accel
-frame
-position of ball
-target feature -> good / bad 
row:
-time

preprocess
-hot encoded
-normalize data to same metric
-normalize positional data to center of player, solves issue of generalization across different angles of videos.

additional features:
-has this joint moved significantly in the last n seconds
-is the ball still in the players hand

find leading factors that decide if jumpshot is good or bad

give insights to user to determine how to improve their jumpshot
